# Implements the bisection method for finding a root of f (x) = 0
# Input: Two real numbers a and b, a < b,
# a continuous function f (x) on [a, b], f (a)f (b) < 0,
# an upper bound on the absolute error tolerance > 0,
# an upper bound on the number of iterations maxIterations
# Output: An approximate (or exact) value x of a root in (a, b)
# or an interval bracketing the root if the iteration number limit is reached
